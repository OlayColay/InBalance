Cluck 3,...,,,,
You 1,...,,,,
Cluck 4,Well that's unfortunate.,,,,
You 2,...,,,,
Cluck 5,"... In any case, since your home is destroyed and the forest is getting attacked, it would make sense if you want to leave the forest. The only way out of here is through the trees to the north and over a canyon to the other side. Normally, it would impossible for anyone to make it through, but luckily for you, I have a few tricks up my sleeve that can help you get safely across. But I'll only help you if you help me and my village to stop the invasion. So what do ya say? Partners?",,,,
Response to offer 1,No,,,,
Response to offer 2,"Burn in hell, chicken man",,,,

Cluck 9 ,"Don't take this the wrong way, but you didn't exactly look like the fighting type. Glad I was wrong.",,,,
Cluck 10,"Anyways, as I was saying, the forest's pretty unstable right now, so it's probably be best if we all just leave. ",,,,
Cluck 11,"Our village is getting attacked pretty badly though, so maybe we can work out some sort of deal?",,,,
Cluck 12,Come to the village and help our people. After that I'll teach you how to get across the canyon.,,,,

Canyon response 1,Why not?,,,,
Canyon response 2,Are you insane?,,,,
Canyon finished 1,"Right before you jump, you suddenly remember that you are a cat, and in fact, do not have wings. You sheepishly turn back around and decide to use one of your nine lives on something far less dangerous and stupid.",,,,

Cluck Village Greeting 1,"Wonderful, you came! Looks like you're the hero this forest needs after all!",,,,

Cluck Finished Saving 1,"Nice! Those spirits didn't stand a chance. You're pretty good at this whole fighting thing y'know. Maybe if you change your mind about leaving the forest, you can come back and be our royal COOPeral. Squawk!",,,,
Cluck Finished Saving 2,"Anyways, I'm sure everyone here is greatful for our valiant effort.  Why not have a gander around town?  I'm sure everyone is greatful for our hard work.  Once you're done, let me know.  There's one more favor I need to ask. ",,,,

Aeolus conjures an attack,,,,,
Aeolus 3,Silence. I grow tired of your voice.,,,,
Aeolus 3,...,,,,
,"I recognize you, Feline.",,,,

,Good day.,,,,
Cluck,Save me my steedddddd...,,,,
,Aeolus Flies away with Cluck.,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
Oblivious NPC,"Oh Sir Cluckers got abducted? Yeah that happens from time to time. Don't let that bother you too much though, but if you  really want to save him, you should go to the canyon area right now. He's probably being held captive over there.",,,,

,,,,,
Door interaction #1,The door to the coop is locked. ,,,,
Chicken Door NPC 1,"You might be wondering, why are none of the chickens hiding inside?",,,,
,"Truth is, all the doors to our coops have door knobs, and well, we don't have any hands to turn them. ",,,,
,"Theoretically, you could help us with that, but unfortunately all of the doors are locked and we've lost the keys.",,,,
,"One of the chicken guards dropped them on the floor one day, and was never able to pick them back up.",,,,

Chicken Door NPC 2A,SQUWAK. LET YOU INSIDE MY HOME? NEVER! GET YOUR FILTHY PAWS OFF MY PROPERTY.,,,,
Chicken Door NPC 2B,Darla's always been awfully protective of her coop.,,,,

,It's funny now that I think about it.,,,,
,"My whole life, I always imagined that it was possible to create a world where spirits and animals could live and coexist in harmony and stability. ",,,,
,"I'm sure you still remember those days, don't you?",,,,
,It felt like merely months ago when all of this was still true.,,,,
,But what I've come to realize these past few years is that power can corrupt even the noblest and most pure of heart.,,,,
,"All it takes is a little push, and the world delves into chaos and unstableness you're witnessing here today.",,,,
,But none of that matters anymore.,,,,
,"My children, my brethen that your kind have murdered, captured and tortured.",,,,
